- **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)** is used to analyze the relationships between books by considering the ratings given by users.  
- The system recommends books that are "similar" to the preferences of each user.  
- It relies on **user ratings** as the primary factor for recommendation.  
- The system identifies books with similar patterns or ratings from other users to generate personalized recommendations.
